        1. Sketching and drawing is a great way to improve your creative skills and start thinking in a different way. Art shows you that there is normally more than one way to solve a problem. Art encourages open minded thinking and creativity. These can be really helpful for personal development and solving problems. Skills you learn through sketching can be applied in a number of different areas in your life.<br />

2. Sketching helps develop a number of different areas of your brain. You develop your ability to focus and pay attention, a skill that can be very useful throughout your life and career. It also develops hand-eye coordination so that everyday tasks can become easier for you. But it also develops strategic thinking, a concept that can be useful to everyone. <br />

3. Sketching can even improve your holistic health. As you build your self esteem and confidence through your art and your sketches as you become better and better. You will get a sense of achievement and start feeling proud of your art which you will carry that confidence through to the rest of your life. Having confidence in your work -whatever it is- is an incredibly useful thing to have.<br />

4. Rest and relaxation is one of the main advantages of sketching, as a hobby. Sketching allows you to sit back and sketch a picture at your own pace. There are no rules and no one telling you what to do, you can just draw whatever you want and have fun while doing it.<br />

5. Sketching can also help you improve your communication skills. Because there are no words in a drawing, well, most of the time, the artist finds other ways to communicate with the audience. This can help you improve your other communication skills by better understanding your feelings and emotions and without the need for words to be spoken.<br />
